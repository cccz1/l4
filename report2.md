This code change is to print out the total length of the md file to compare it to the currentindex inside the loop to discover the reason why the infinite loop happened.
The code was in an infinite loop whenever there's an empty line at the end of the md file.<br />
the bug was undiscovered at this time, but the symptom was the infinite loop.
